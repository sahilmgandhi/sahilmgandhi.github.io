								<a href="images/PacmanLarge.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/PacmanSmall.png" alt="" /></a>
								<h3 style="text-align:center;">Pacman.java</h3>
								<p style="text-align:center;">The classical game of Pacman ... but with a few new, cool twists :). Enjoy a game where Pacman has to get all the cheese bits in a grid, while avoiding many 
                                ghosts that can move in any of the 8-directions around them. For added fun, click on the "God-Mode" or "Freeze" buttons!</p>

								<a href="images/imageEditLarge.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/imageEditSmall.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3 style="text-align:center;">ImageEditor.java</h3>
								<p style="text-align:center;">Perform some photoshop edits like flipping pictures vertically and horizontally, or even changing their color scale to negative or grayscale. You can 
                                even combine several of these edits together to create some "fun" images.</p>

								<h3 style="text-align:center;">KickDuino</h3>
								<p style="text-align:center;">An arduino based solution to stop the passenger behind you from kicking the seat and give you some peace of mind. Depending on the frequency and 
                                    strength of the kicks, an LED light flashes on the passenger's screen, effectively annoying them from kicking you further or staying on long enough for a 
                                    flight attendant to handle the situation.</p>
