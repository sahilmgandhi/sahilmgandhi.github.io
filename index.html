                             <p>The Bruin Dining Backend API was developed in the frustration of individual developers on different platforms having to perform their own webscraping of the UCLA dining hall items. Now they have an endpoint where they can merely perform GET requests to get menus, prices, ingredients, recipes, and more for dining halls and fast food cafes in well formatted JSON. Developers can use this API in their web/mobile applications or to do statistical analysis on the variety of food options offered at UCLA. As associating Android Application is in the process as well!

I used Autodesk Eagle to design the schematic and PCB of the robot and MBED to program the MCU (an STM-32F411). The robot ended up placing in the top 15 at both the UCLA and UCSD competitions, and I intend to do this competition again to improve my robot!

									<p style="text-align:center;">I worked with a team to create the infrastructure to monitor data from the routers and visualize the data to gain valuable business analytics. For the infrastructure, we used Docker containers and Apache Flume to create a flow of data from the Hubs to our local lab environment. We then automated the infrastructure deployment and AWS/VMware VM provisioning process with Ansible in order for it to be generalized for any future deployments. Once production data was being captured, we processed the Spark streams with the data using Scala and stored the processed data into OpenTSDB. We then graphed data using Grafana to let business leaders make critical decisions of the Arclight network.</p>

									<p style="text-align:center;">I primarily worked on the company's Master Data Management (MDM) product to tailor it to individual customers' needs. This responsibility included developing and modifying features in the API (Java, Cassandra, Elasticsearch), UI (Qooxdoo), and metadata configurations (JSON). In addition, I also found and fixed several major bugs within the product's code base before the next version of the API and UI went live. Throughout the internship, I used Git extensively to manage my workflow and simultaneously work on the code with developers from around the world, and gained a critical understanding of both SaaS and PaaS models of service and how either can be beneficial for a company's future.</p>
